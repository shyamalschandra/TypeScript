# Assume everything should be stored verbatim unless otherwise specified.
# Note that we don't use 'binary' because it is an alias for '-text -diff'
# '-text' means "don't try to adjust line-endings", which is what we want, but
# '-diff' tells git "don't even try to diff these." which is undesirable.
